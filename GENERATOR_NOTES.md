* Consider first domino, and adjust utils and unit tests accordingly.
* Start thinking about play utils

* Basic UI that shows board and matrix
    * Demo page
    * Need blank domino svgs
        * All possible intervals * three orientations = 18 total
            * Helper to retrieve for orientation
    * Already have pitch svgs, but move under faces
    * Rename and reorganise svgs
